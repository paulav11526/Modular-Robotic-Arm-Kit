# Layout
Each part folder contains batch and individual files as well as a video on how to remove supports and use the part. 

### .gcode files
Send the .gcode files directly to 3D Printers. Sliced for the Prusa MK4 with PLA. While the individual part files are included if needed, the MakerSpace team would prefer that the batch file is used and a collection of spare parts are kept by the TAs/Professors in order to not occupy too many printers.


### .3mf files
Used for viewing and modifying supports on a specific part. Can be sliced to obtain a .gcode file.

### .zip or .SLDPRT files
.zip - SolidWorks Pack and Go of an Assembly

.SLDPRT - SolidWorks Part


Used for modifying the part. Refer to specific part ReadMe files for details on custom supports and printing settings and refer to the .3mf file for clarification.
