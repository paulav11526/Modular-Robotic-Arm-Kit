# Modular-Robotic-Arm-Kit
This repository contains the necessary files to 3D print your own Modular Robotics Kit. 

## Layout
Within each specific part folder, Individual Files, Batch Files, and a ReadMe is provided. 

The part-specific ReadMe will detail slicer settings, support types, filament, etc as well as provide a video for how to remove supports and operate the joint or link. 

The Individual File folder contains .3mf, .bgcode, and .SLDPRT/.SLDASM/.zip files (see below for use cases). 

The Batch File folder contains only a ReadMe file with a hyperlink to the .bgcode file as it is too large to store on GitHub.

### .bgcode files
Send the .bgcode files directly to 3D Printers to get more parts. Sliced for the Prusa MK4 printer with the joint's corresponding filament (see specific part ReadMe). While the individual part files are included if needed, the MakerSpace team would prefer that the batch file is used and a collection of spare parts are kept by the TAs/Professors in order to not occupy too many printers.

### .SLDPRT, .SLDASM, .zip files
.zip or .SLDASM - SolidWorks Assembly

.SLDPRT - SolidWorks Part


Used for modifying the part. Refer to specific part ReadMe files for details on custom supports and printing settings and refer to the .3mf file for clarification.

### .3mf files
Used for viewing and modifying supports on a specific part. Supports should be compared with these files when modifying a part. Can be sliced to obtain a .bgcode file.
